Hi guys. I have uploaded a prototype sprite sheet and .xcf file that contains some buildings, a petrol station, a gasoline tank, and more. 
-
The sprite sheets are not yet to be completed. Sorry in advance. However, the sprites are in the state of ready-to-use. 
-
Feel free to use and slice the sprites into a Unity project to test the sprites in an actual project environment. 
-
If anything, please prompt me in the group. Thx
